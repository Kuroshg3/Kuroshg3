# [Hi there, my name is Kurosh :)](https://github.com/Kuroshg3/Kuroshg3/blob/master/README.md)
I am very glad that you are visiting my page.
My goal is to be a good coder and sysadmin or even better.

At first, PocketMine MP made me interested in computers, and because of that, I learned a little bit of PHP.
After that I started learning Python.
The requirement to know Linux also led me to start learning it.
Right now, as I am writing this message, I have learned the basic lessons of Git.
And I just started learning HTML and CSS. It's an endless learning, I'm glad I chose my path.
Although I have not gone deep into it, the computer really has an interesting world.
